The wiring is correct as I tested other's sensors with i2cdetect -y 1, and their devices showed up.
Mine does not show up, I already checked the soldering with the microscope and do not see any issues.
I also checked the voltage on the multimeter and oscilloscope, based on my research, the voltage should spike when using the i2cdetect command.
It is having a constant voltage, which for me, suggests that the board is defective.
I will go and ask help from Kelly and Vlad tomorrow as the lab is closed for today.
If the issue persists after tomorrow, I will purchase a new sensor from Adafruit, a company well trusted.
